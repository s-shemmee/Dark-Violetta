# Violetta Dark VSCode Theme

*Dark Violetta is a beautiful dark VSCode theme for coders. It is carefully designed with a pinch of purple to satisfy your code-loving heart. It has the perfect balance of colors for those who prefer the dark side of coding. With this project, I wanted to create something that would give me the best experience in coding possible and I hope it does the same for you!*

*Any feedback is appreciated, thanks <3*
